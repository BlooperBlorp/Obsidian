Aeglirin got it's name from the local community of elvish (?) [[Druids]]
who inhabited the land before they were kicked out by the first settlers

### Location 
Aeglirin about a weeks travel from the largest city [[Arabel]], bordering on the [[Hullack Forrest]], just up on the mountain on a crude path from the main roads. It is on a small outcrop high up in the mountains

### Development: 
The city popped up just recently, perhaps a month or 2 ago (depending on who you ask) as the rush to obtain and extract resources from the [[gash in the weave]] began 

There are crude structures people call "houses". A secondary market has begun to emerge for people bringing services to the town, inns, medics, taverns, supplies shops - but they don't have much. There are also some nicer dwellings from the high wizards, larger governments, and merchant groups. 

### Inhabitants
The inhabitants include wizards and mages trying to study the break in the weave and it's effects, prospectors trying to make a quick buck, artificers that are buying the [[Weave infused materials]] for use, and large merchant organizations and governments looking to extract resources from the newly found supply of magic. 

Followers of Mystra have come to pray as they want to get closer to their god. They are currently unsure about Mystra thinks on the matter as she has been silent 

There are also some local [[Druids]] who are fighting back as their holy land is being stepped on quite literally as they were kicked out into the nearby [[Hullack Forrest]]

### Resources
The trace amounts of [[Weave infused materials]] that *were* in Aeglirin have been taken up and most people take trips deeper into the [[Thunder Peaks]] as they try to look for resources. Depending on their persuasion they may travel deep into the [[mines]] or just trip further into the treacherous mountain range
