Aeglirin got it's name from the local community of elvish (?) [[Druids]]
who inhabited the land before they were kicked out by the first settlers

### Location 
Aeglirin about a weeks travel from the largest city [[Arabel]], bordering on the [[Hullack Forrest]], just up the mountain on a crude path from the main roads 

### Development: 
The city popped up just recently, perhaps a month or 2 ago (depending on who you ask) as the rush to obtain and extract resources from the weave began 

There are crude structures people call "houses". A secondary market has begun to emerge for people bringing services to the town, inns, medics, taverns, supplies shops - but they don't have much. 

### Inhabitants
The inhabitants include wizards and mages trying to study the break in the weave and it's effects, prospectors trying to make a quick buck, and large merchant organizations and governments looking to extract resources from the newly found supply of magic. 

There are also some local [[Druids]] who are fighting back as their holy land is being stepped on quite literally as they were kicked out into the nearby [[Hullack Forrest]]

### Resources
The trace amounts of [[weave infused materials]] that *were* in Aeglirin have been taken up and most people take trips deeper into the [[Thunder Peaks]] as they try to look for resources. Depending on their persuasion they may travel deep into the [[mines]] or just trip further into the treacherous mountain range
