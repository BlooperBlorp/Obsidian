Things that exite me:


### The world
- There has been a gash created in the weave, deep underground by a mountain range called the Thunder Peaks
	- The weave is *THE* way that magic is used. All magic depends on the weave. 
	- It flows through everything in the world, people, plants, structures, touching almost every corner of existence.
		- For a deeper explanation of the weave: 
			- Magic users access the weave 
			- The spells of Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards is called 'arcane magic', relying on an understanding (whether learned or innate or a combination) of the weave in order 
			- The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are called divine magic. Access to the weave is given to them by a god, the divine forces of nature, or devotion

Magic Flowing from the earth
	- Settlement called [[Aeglirin]] has popped up as people move towards it 
	- There is a [[gash in the weave]] deep under the ground, which has caused [[Weave infused materials]] to begin surfacing.
