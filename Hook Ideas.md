### Idea 1
You've all been told about a man who seemed to be at the [[gash in the weave]] before anyone else, everyone claims that he was there before them, other than the druids, they don't know where he came from. (or rather, when the gash in the weave happened, the druids pulled up and this dude was the first guy there).
- He knows the whereabouts of a huge deposit that he was planning a group expedition to
- He knows more things about the origin of the weave than most people do
- He might even know how to repair it
