There has been a gash in the weave deep under [[Thunder Peaks]],  causing many effects.

1. [[Weave infused materials]] have begun to surface around the area (and deep under ground). These are materials infused with raw magic. 
2. Spell casters in the area are affected
	1. when you cast a spell, roll a d10. On a 1 or a 10 your spell is countered and you roll on the (custom?) wild magic table.
3. Followers of Mystra are deeply stressed as she is gravely injured. She is being quiet about the specifics of this injury however.

The gash in the weave has led to the development of the township [[Aeglirin]], an outpost for research, collection, and investigation of the gash. From the city there are [[mines]] that travel deeper towards the gash
